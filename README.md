# Libft-42
<h3>What is Libft?⁉️</h3>
The Libft project, was my first project in 42 school, The primary objective of this project is to reinforce students' understanding of C programming by having them recreate a library of standard C functions from scratch. This library, aptly named "libft," is a custom implementation of several commonly used functions found in the C standard library, such as those for string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked list management.
