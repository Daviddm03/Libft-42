# Libft-42 üìö
<h3>What is Libft ‚ÅâÔ∏è</h3>
The Libft project was my first project in 42 school, the primary objective of this project is to reinforce students' understanding of C programming by having them recreate a library of standard C functions from scratch. This library, aptly named "libft," is a custom implementation of several commonly used functions found in the C standard library, such as those for string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked list management.

<h3>Key points üîë</h3>

**Makefile**
- The Makefile automates the library compilation process, facilitating the creation and cleaning of compiled files through specific commands.

**Memory Allocation**
- Functions for memory allocation and management are implemented to optimize resource usage, ensuring efficient and safe memory handling.

**String Manipulation**
- A set of functions is developed to facilitate string manipulation, including operations such as length calculation, duplication, copying, concatenation and character search.

**Linked Lists**
- Specific functions are created for creating and manipulating linked lists, allowing dynamic insertion, removal and iteration over elements.

**Tests**
- The project includes a systematic approach to testing the functionality and efficiency of implemented functions, ensuring they operate as expected.

<h3>Conclusion ‚úÖ</h3>
The Libft project culminates in a robust, custom C library that reflects the functionality of the standard C library. This achievement represents more than just completing a task; means a solid understanding of fundamental programming concepts and the ability to write efficient, maintainable code. We develop a solid foundation for future projects. Libft not only prepares students for future challenges, but also instills a sense of confidence and accomplishment by proving their ability to tackle complex programming tasks right from the start.
